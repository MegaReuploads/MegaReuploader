# MegaReuploader
MegaReuploader (MR) is an open-source program capable of "archiving" a video, a playlist, or even an entire YouTube channel, simply by using the URL, thanks to Python programming and yt-dlp.
Going deeper into "archiving," the program gives the user the option to download video thumbnails, metadata (likes, description, title, views, etc.) and choose the video quality, all directly in the Windows terminal.

MR is able to support a community of reuploaders of deleted videos and lost media from YouTube, being able to archive videos that even the Wayback Machine cannot.

In general, MR is a program with a simple, user-friendly UI that anyone can use to download their favorite videos or archive them before they are permanently deleted.
